## Backstory
I was a student of the first installment of the ReDI Hamburg School of Digital Integration course. The program was a huge success, and towards completion, students were allowed to form groups and come up with a project plan.

The course I enrolled in was Introduction to Computer Science. Several tutors were introduced to teach us basics on 
* Command Line Basics
* Version Control with Git and GitHub
* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Basic knowledge of Python

My group(of 2) were familiar with using Python, so we came up with building a simple game. A tic-tac-toe game.

The game is played on the CLI as it features no graphics.

After several going back and forth, the game was completed without being "smart"; the computer player only used a random function to decide where on the board to play. We presented this, and as a challenge, one of our instructors told us to make it "smart".

And guess what? - we did. We made it unbeatable. Thanks to an algorithm we found for games of this category, called zero-sum games. Look up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax for more info.

With this, the game itself was complete, and with the knowledge from HTML from the course, results of the gameplay were written to an html file and displayed on a web browser.
